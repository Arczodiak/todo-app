The Project files are a basic to-do list manager which uses a database to save both a personal account created as well as the errands saved under each specific account. 
It is interconnected with a .js server which recieved the data from the external interfaces in real time.

These interfaces include:
 -a browser client
 - an electron client
 - an endroid application

This project gives a small scale demonstration of how larger applications or programs can all be connected via a central server which monitors their user action from a varied array of external client formats.
